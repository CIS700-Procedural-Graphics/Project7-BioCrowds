# BioCrowds

A Biocrowds implementation with 3 different scenarios:

- Opposite - Two opposing groups of agents assigned to corners with goals on opposite corners. 
- Lined - Two opposing lines of agents with goals on opposite sides of the grid. 
- Home - Agents move towards a single goal point.

The GUI supports modifying the following parameters:

- Grid Width - Modify the size of the grid in which the agents lie.
- Agent Density - Modify the density of the agent groups.
- Agent Speed - Change the agent speed.
- Marker Density - Increase the number of markers per tile in the grid.
- Scenario - Choose from one of three scenarios mentioned above.
- Goal X Position - Change the x component of the goal positions of all the agents (overwrites the predefined goal points of the scenarios).
- Goal Z Position - Change the z component of the goal positions of all the agents (overwrites the predefined goal points of the scenarios).
- Pause - Pause movement of agents.
